# 0.13 Release

The Veloren 0.13 release is coming up on the 24th of July! In preparation for
this release, we want to tell you a bit about the release party.

## Release Party

We'll have a special release party map.

## Sea Shanty by @Christof

Have you ever wanted to be part of a team working together like we do at Veloren by
just singing? Become part of the Veloren-Shanty*-Choir!

Since the 0.13 release will be sea-themed, we had the idea to record a Shanty,
featuring all @Contributors (who we can motivate to sing). Over the course of the
last few weeks, a talented team of musicians have created lyrics, melody (Alto), and
choir voices (Soprano, Tenor, Bass) for a song and I figured out how to create
karaoke videos from there.

So please pick your favorite voice to play on headphones, read the lyrics on
screen and sing along into your microphone. Record either all in one piece or
per stanza (I preferred singing each stanza four times and then selected the one
least out of tune/rhythm) and send the recordings to 0.13 Release Shanty
Soundfiles. Uncompressed (.wav or .flac) has best quality, but we would rather
prefer a mobile phone recording by you over no contribution. If you prefer to
cut your audio files before sending them, audacity is a good free option
available for all systems.

@Gudrun has recorded all four stanzas (the last is identical to the
first one) in Alto voice to give you an example to learn the rhythm ‚Äì which is
tricky at times. Of course we will record real instruments in parallel and
@DaforLynx will give it a good mixing. The end result will be surely
great, become part of the promotion trailer and play in specific locations in
game.

If you feel that professional music is too great of a challenge for you, bring
yourself into the right mood by putting a Pirate‚Äôs hat and an eye patch on,
imagine a hook on your arm and a saber at your side, sip on a themed beverage of
your choice, ‚Ä¶, then roar along with increased passion and confidence.

*) Take a look here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_shanty ‚ÄúA sea shanty is a
genre of traditional folk song that was once commonly sung as a work song to
accompany rhythmical labor aboard large merchant sailing vessels.‚Äù Maybe the
next time when stuck at coding, we should have an online conference ‚ô´ to get
into the flow üõ∂.

Choose whichever one you like to learn your voice. All recordings must be sung
along one of these to keep matching tune and rhythm. The recording should only
include your own voice. Sheet

For all those who can read music, helpful understanding your voice (be careful,
each voice  has its own line)

## Feature Freeze

Hey @Contributor  @DevPingSquad ,

0.13 release is on Saturday, 2022-07-23 18:00 GMT

As usual, there will be a feature freeze starting from 2022-07-16 18:00 GMT. We recommend submitting critical and large MRs for review now, before the feature freeze.

This release will also have a stress test event between the feature freeze and the release. We will be sharing further details of this later.

Getting your large MR merged before feature freeze
Please mention @xMAC94x[GMT+2]  in the ReleaseMRs_0.13 thread with a short summary with the following details (the more, the better):
* What is complete
* What needs to be done
* Can your feature be partially introduced to master in its current state (as multiple MRs)?
* Do you foresee any issues with your MR and if so, which ones?
* Why should this feature be in 0.13?

This is required to align our testing and review strategies to ensure a smooth release.
