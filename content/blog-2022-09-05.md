## @tormeh

A while back I added a modification to NPC behavior where NPCs with a certain
personality and above a certain health threshold would attack others if there
were no one else nearby (i.e. no witnesses)

## @floppy

We have been working on playable music instruments that allow players to combine their collected instruments into (hopefully) enjoyable sounds.

The guitar in the video uses samples, recorded by @Oolnokk, the model was
created by MerlinMan.
